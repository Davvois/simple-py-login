# simple-py-login
SimplePyLogin it's a simple bank login that I made too challenge my Python skills. <br>
As you can see, the code is pretty messy, but once I'm done with updating and adding new things <br>
to the source code, I'll probably clean it and optimize it. <br>

Is this a waste of time? YES!<br>
Am I having fun coding it? Probably YES! So I'll update this until it's finished <br><br>

I think that these passwords can also be "cracked" with my password-cracker tool in my repositories, <br>
this needs to be tested, and somehow I will test it, but I dunno. <br><br>
